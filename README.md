# Deepstack Labs
This repo tracks my path into deep blockchain security and Rust systems.  
Everything here is hands-on — experiments, notes, and small projects to build real understanding from first principles.

## Focus
- Learning Rust through building and breaking  
- Understanding Solana & low-level runtime behavior  
- Exploring security across EVM, bridges, and rollups  
- Mapping attack surfaces and reproducing real bugs

## Approach
I learn by running code, debugging, and documenting what I break.  
Each commit is a snapshot of progress — not perfection.

## Current Goals
1. Master Rust patterns used in Solana programs  
2. Recreate small vulnerabilities and reason about their cause  
3. Build tools to automate small parts of auditing
